Our entry into this year's Junction hackathon was developed for the Mobility track. We chose to tackle Ensto's challenge.

We have developed a prototype of a customer-facing app that attempts to handle these use-cases:

- Loading money onto a user's account through bank, card or MobilePay
- A map view that lists charging stations in the area
- Options for starting/stopping the charge process
